# Java Design Patterns: Strategy and Factory Method

This project demonstrates the **Strategy** and **Factory Method** design patterns through a practical example. The focus is on providing reusable, extensible solutions for common software development problems and testing them using **JUnit**.

## Design Patterns Overview

### 1. Strategy Pattern
**Purpose**:  
Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms or behaviors, enabling dynamic selection at runtime without altering the base class.  

**Key Features**:
- Allows defining multiple strategies (algorithms/behaviors) that implement a common interface.
- Provides flexibility to extend functionality by adding new strategies without modifying existing code.
- Useful in scenarios where objects require different behaviors depending on their type or context.

### 2. Factory Method Pattern
**Purpose**:  
Handles object creation by delegating instantiation logic to specialized factory methods.  

**Key Features**:
- Simplifies object creation by encapsulating it within a factory class.
- Enables central management of object creation logic, improving maintainability and extensibility.
- Ideal for cases where multiple subclasses or types need to be instantiated dynamically.
